## Description

Why I decided to create this?
Basically, I've been following along the data from John Hopkins and worldmeters.info and found it great to understand how each region of the world is tracking. I wanted though to be able to see the graphs that worldmeters provide on a more local scale.

To my knowledge, worldmeters does not provide the COVID-19 data they use, so I've used the only other reliable source I know.

**NOTE: The situation with COVID-19 changes rapidly, and so this should only be used as a guide.**
